# ipa-features-from-text
"Translates" English text/words to IPA (can be modified to work with other langauges). Categorizes IPA letters by their IPA featuers (see IPA chart). Saves features of words to machine/deep learning friendly database: one column per feature, and True if the word has this feature, False if not.
